# Heya! :3

Welcome to my profile. I just want to note that (some of) my projects and all future projects will now be hosted on my [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/kita). This account will still be used to report issues and contribute to some projects, though. Just don't upload my code from there to GitHub as Copilot is a license violating machine.
