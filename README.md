### Hi there!! I'm searinminecraft!

* A random guy that plays Roblox, SuperTuxKart, and Minecraft.
* I like coding random stuff in Python. Example being my [STKAddons TUI Frontend](https://github.com/searinminecraft/stkaddons-cli) and my Revolt bot called [doingus](https://github.com/searinminecraft/doingus)
* I also like to draw, although they're not as good as my IRL best friend['](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100070729325593)s drawings.
* I help translate open source projects to Filipino. Examples being [Revolt](https://github.com/revoltchat) and [SuperTuxKart](https://supertuxkart.net/fil/Main_Page)
* I use [Artix](https://artixlinux.org) BTW (runit <3)
* Currently trying out [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org) (of course has systemd)
* Owner of the [SuperTuxKart Revolt Server](https://rvlt.gg/1Rw7Nevx)
* Contributor of the [Frankfurt STK Wiki](https://stk.kimden.online/wiki) (a wiki dedicated to SuperTuxKart related things, still broken as heck)
