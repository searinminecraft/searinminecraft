# This account is mostly abandoned now.

This account will no longer be used for hosting source code, due to concerns of GitHub Copilot. You can read more at [the No GitHub page](https://nogithub.codeberg.page). I can be seen on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/kita), [Disroot Forgejo](https://git.disroot.org/kita) and [KaKi's git](https://git.kaki87.net/kita)

That does not mean this account won't be used anymore though, it will still be used for reporting issues to GitHub repositories, and maybe even contribute to some projects. But I kindly ask you to not upload my work on Codeberg to GitHub, it can make me happy.

If you want to see the original profile, you can look at the raw contents (commented out at the bottom)

### Hi there!! I'm searinminecraft!

* A random guy that plays Roblox, SuperTuxKart, and Minecraft.
* I like coding random stuff in Python. Example being my [STKAddons TUI Frontend](https://github.com/searinminecraft/stkaddons-cli) and my Revolt bot called [doingus](https://github.com/searinminecraft/doingus)
* I also like to draw, although they're not as good as my (former) IRL best friend's drawings.
* I help translate open source projects to Filipino. Examples being [Revolt](https://github.com/revoltchat) and [SuperTuxKart](https://supertuxkart.net/fil/Main_Page)
* I use [Artix](https://artixlinux.org) BTW (runit <3)
* Currently trying out [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org) (of course has systemd)
* Owner of the [SuperTuxKart Revolt Server](https://app.revolt.chat/invite/01GVQJVVFM233EHBV03K7B3HF5)
* Contributor of the [Frankfurt STK Wiki](https://stk.kimden.online/wiki) (a wiki dedicated to SuperTuxKart related things, still broken as heck)
* I also code a Discord bot, which is a port of [linaSTK in discord.py](https://github.com/searinminecraft/lina-discord)
